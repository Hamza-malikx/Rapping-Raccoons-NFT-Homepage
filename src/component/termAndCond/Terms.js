            administrative expenses incurred by the Promoter).
          </li>

            To the greatest extent permitted by law, the Promoter excludes all
            warranties, representations or guarantees (Warranties) regarding the
            Promotion and any prizes, including any Warranties which may have
            been made in the course of advertising or promoting the Promotion.
            The conduct of the Promotion or the supply of prizes may involve
            third parties, and the Promoter makes no Warranties and disclaims
            all liability in connection with any such third parties, their acts
            or omissions. By entering the Promotion, an entrant releases and
            indemnifies the Promoter and its related bodies corporate (including
            the officers, employees and agents of each) from and against all
            actions, penalties, liabilities, claims or demands the entrant may
            have against the Promoter or that the Promoter may incur for any
            loss or damage which is or may be suffered or sustained as a direct
            or indirect result of an entrant entering or participating in the
            Promotion or winning or failing to win a prize, or using or
            permitting any other person to use the prize, except for any
            liability which cannot be excluded by law or which would cause any
            part of this clause to be void or unenforceable.
          </li>
          <li>
            If despite the foregoing clause, the Promoter incurs a liability to
            an entrant under any law which implies a Warranty into these Terms
            of entry which cannot legally be excluded, the Promoter’s liability
            in respect of the Promotion is limited, in the Promoter’s
            discretion, to either resupplying such goods or services as form
            part of the Promotion, or paying the cost of resupplying those goods
            or services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Without limiting any of the foregoing, in no circumstances will an
            entrant or the Promoter have any liability to the other for any loss
            or damage suffered which is indirect or consequential in nature,
            including without limitation any loss of profit, loss of reputation,
            loss of goodwill, or loss of business opportunity.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Promoter and its associated agencies and companies will not be
            liable for any delay, damage, or loss in transit of prizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Promoter may in its absolute discretion not accept a particular
            entry, may disqualify an entry, or cancel the entire Promotion at
            any time without giving reasons and without liability to any
            entrants. Without limiting this the Promoter reserves the right to
            verify the validity of entries, prize claims and entrants and to
            disqualify any entrant who submits an entry or prize claim that is
            misleading or not in accordance with these Terms of entry or who
            manipulates or tampers with the entry process. In the event that a
            winner breaches these Terms of entry, the winner will forfeit the
            prize in whole and no substitute will be offered. Verification is at
            the discretion of the Promoter, whose decision is final. Failure by
            the Promoter to enforce any of its rights at any stage does not
            constitute a waiver of those rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prizes, or any unused portion of a prize, are not transferable or
            exchangeable and cannot be taken as cash. Where a prize is
            unavailable for any reason, the Promoter may substitute the prize
            for another item of equal or higher value. The Promoter accepts no
            responsibility for any variation in prize value (including between
            advertising of the Promotion and receipt of the prize).
          </li>
          <li>
            In the case of the intervention of any outside act, agent or event
            which prevents or significantly hinders the Promoter’s ability (or
            that of a third party involved with the Promotion) to proceed with
            the Promotion on the dates and in the manner described in these
